\section{Experiments with Least Latency Adaptation}

Our results in the previous section show that leveraging location diversity using parallel TCP connections blurs differences between various TE schemes. In this section, we experiment with an adaptation scheme which chooses a user chooses the location with the least latency among multiple locations at which content is available. This adaptation scheme is similar to those used by CDNs today.
