\subsection{Experiments with \shrink\ protoype}


\subsection{Trace-driven experiments}




(1) Energy savings: AllOn, Shrink, LowerBound. (server part shows request \& content transfer energy).

Shrink, Shrink with random shutdown (error-bars),  Shrink with randomly shuffling load-balancing rules (error-bars).

(2) Availability: AllOn \& Shrink with different frequencies of adaptation; Shrink without considering initial utilization.

(3) OriginRequests: AllOn, Shrink (content-transfers), Shrink (pre-shutdown wait), Shrink (no effort).

(4) On-off transitions: Shrink with varying extra wait times for shutdown. Also show energy savings.


Other experiments:

(1) Storage: Origin requests. Fraction of energy savings.

(2) Traditional topologies: 

(3) Content chunking:  

(4) Fault tolerance: Server-fault tolerance, switch-fault tolerance.
