1. if the primary purpose of network is content delivery, how would you architect it differently.

2. I am advocating a different architecture. Every network should be an NCDN.

1. status quo: <network layer> and <applications layer>: open flow based controller that combines both 

2. content router: 

- can routers support caching of content ?

- design of content caching router.


How much valuable is network layer information for content delivery?

- link load

1. What are the advantages of having a CDN functionality in a network ?

Q. My goal is to design a NCDN system.
A. Deliver content using a network and routers.

1. Design of content servers.
2. 

Q. How can the network assist in content delivery?
A. 

- support different QoS
- caches accompanying routers


- caching
- 

Assume that anything and everything can be cached.

Every network wants to include CDN functionality in their network.

Which locations to serve each content from.


Variety of content: web, 



Network has caches installed at every pop.



Think that each network must support content caching and delivery.


Be an akamai : mapping problem. <---aaa---> : 


Assume that each ISP supports CONNECTIVITY + CONTENT DELIVERY.

Controller: <>



Assume that if internet as a whole were to support content caching and delivery for all content.
