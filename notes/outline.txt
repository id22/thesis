- If Internet were not only a medium for routing packet to hosts, but also responded to users' requests for content. (Thats its primary function anyway.)

Making content delivery through the Internet easier for content providers.


Managing a Network with Integrated Content Delivery Functionality


Network has the liberty to cache and serve users' requests.



Impact of Content replication  on ISP network management.

Impact of Pervasive Content caching on ISP network management.
	- Special case: highly cacheable workload, bandwidth >> server compute resources.


Content replication taking server resources into account: 


How to handle workload with lower cache hit rates taking server resources into account.
	- Decide which locations to serve users from. 
	- 
	- 

, and leverage deployments in other networks.

Geographic distribution of content workloads.






What are the assumptions?

Routing, server-load.



1. Compute resources are adequate.
2. Workload highly amenable to caching.
3. 
4. 



Not all workloads are amenable to caching. 
- Several workloads: amenable to caching.
- Compute resources are finite: certain workloads 

- Joint 


Some questions:

1. The current abstraction of host-to-host communication provides enough functionality to perform all tasks.
2. Is it feasible to think that networks tomorrow will have caching tomorrow. 

Lets assume that we were designing a network CDN.

- Current Model:
	- Internet: 
	- CDN:
	- DIY: 


- Why would networks  want to send traffic 


- Administrative domain: (Links, Routers, Servers)

Current state of affairs:

- CDN 1
- CDN 2

In a network with pervasive caching functionality:

	- primary problem: 

- How to do it?

- What functionality does network provide?
	- Content caching.

(1) resource management in geo-distributed platforms

- Today's Internet services runs on geo-distributed computing platforms.
- Why are they geo-distributed?
	reduces the latency from user to content it is accessing, 
	path optimizations
	fault tolerance.
- Ubiquitous: all content distribution and web services run on a geo-distributed platforms.
- Heterogeneity. Examples: CDNs, public clouds, private clouds.
- How to manage resources to maximize performance.

- Sophisticated approaches based on planning, prior history, knowledge of system behaviour: Planned schemes
- Simple approaches that are unplanned, operate on local knowledge.



This thesis investigates the following question: (1) Should resource allocation in content distribution be done in a planned or an unplanned manner? Are there specific scenarios where unplanned approaches perform poorly ? Or a planned approach can give considerable improvements over simple unplanned strategies.

- Examples:
	0. Traffic engineering: if we consider the effect of application level adaptation, an different between planned and unplanned reduces
	1. Network CDN: unplanned wins
	2. Hybrid CDN: planned is hard to implement, so unplanned wins
	3. 

This thesis makes a case 

Locality-aware placement: 

Planned scheme:


Formulate a planned vs unplanned problem in a cloud scenario.

Sophisticated planned schemes for resource allocation on geo-distributed platforms.

Sophisticated planned schemes for resource allocation on geo-distributed platforms are either hard to implement, or provide minimal gains.
