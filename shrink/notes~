background:

key points of the paper:

- Energy savings are possible via consolidation, but what is the performance impact?
 
- Performance impact is due to increased load and due to increased miss rates. to what extent do each of these affect performance?

- Do simple server provisioning and load balancing techniques provide an acceptable tradeoff?

- explain 

What should the background section say?

- what is a cdc?

- how do CDCs optimize performance?

- why is energy a concern for CDCs?

GOAL:

- reduce energy
- improve performance
- improve reliability

challenge: tradeoff


limitation of prior work:

- do not model the interaction between server consolidation and load balancing, and hence do not accurately capture the performance impact.

why is it necessary?

1. determines cache hit rates with consolidation

2. determines load-dependent latency. in the ideal, load evenly distributed. for the same level of consolidation, minimal load-dependent latency. uneven distribution could increase load-dependent latency and the performance degradation due to consolidation.


design:

- server consolidation & adapts load balancing, which enables an accurate quantification of energy-performance tradeoff.

- provides knobs to operators to achieve the desired tradeoff between energy use, performance and reliability.


analysis:

under what conditions are good tradeoffs achievable.

summary: suggests enouraging tradeoffs are achievable for zipfian workloads provided utilization increases at a slow rate.


 

evaluation:

1. quantify the tradeoff and compare it to the best achievable.
2. relative contribution of the two factors
3. sensitivity of findings to system parameters and available resources.


discussion:

1. power cost:
